# Learning modern Java the playful way

Hi! \
This is a demo project for a talk by Marit and Piotr.
Please don't use the things you see in the `main` branch in production, this branch exists only as a starting point for our talk. If you're intrigued by how this code can be modernized, please find the talk on YouTube. And remember to leave a star ;-)

As usual, you may wish to start with `./mvnw verify`. Please make sure you have JDK 25 installed.

Thank you!
